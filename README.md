# Search-CVE-script
It's a python script with some fonction about CVE. It's my first useful python script so please be understanding.

The main goal of this script was to be aware of new vulnabilities of the day. It search on the ANSSI website (the French security agency) for new vulnerabilities and use NIST api for some detail about the CVEs.  

How to use it ?

searchcve.py -h                                       -> show this help message and exit
searchcve.py -u                                       -> show today\'s CVE (I use cron job every day night)
searchcve.py -i INPUT_FILE [-o OUTPUT]                -> seach cve in input xls file
searchcve.py -k KEYWORD --version VERSION [-o OUTPUT] -> search cve with a product/vendor and version
searchcve.py -c CVE                                   -> Get some detail about a cve
