# CVE Search python script
It's a python script with some fonction about CVE. It's my first useful python script.

The main goal of this script was to be aware of new vulnabilities of the day. It search on the ANSSI website (the French security agency) for new vulnerabilities and use NIST api for some detail about the CVEs.  

How to use it ?
